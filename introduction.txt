- general introduction about human observing possibilities using radar

Short range radar is recently widely studied for its micro-Doppler observing capabilities.
Among other sensors, such as a video camera or thermal imaging camera, radar offers measurements based on determining the distance and speed of an object without collecting imaging data.
It can operate in almost all conditions while maintaining the near anonymity of observed targets, such as moving people or cars.

One of the possibilities of using theses special features of radar is its integration in smart home systems to improve safety and security.
It can include various types of functionalities such as unusual movement detection or measurement of human heart rate and respiratory rate, while maintaining comfort and cost-effectiveness.
This is therefore a great opportunity when there is a need of touch-free vital signs sensor, for example in various medical cases or in the elder care.
Another life-saving issue is the detection of dangerous falls, especially on steep stairs or while bathing.
The latter case is particularly important because tactile accelerometers, as in many situations, are not a convenient solution here.

In recent years, much attention has been paid to better understand measurement-related phenomena and develop hardware and signal processing solutions regarding the use of radar in the above areas.
Furthermore, much research has been conducted on the development of non-contact user-friendly interfaces based on gesture recognition.
The first commercially available gesture-classifying radar in a mobile phone already appeared a few years ago in the case of the Google Pixel 4.
