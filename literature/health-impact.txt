Human Health Ascpects of radar operation
Gregory Barshtein

electro-bio-physical phenomena, not health effects

Background:


Skin reaction,
pains
headaches
Dizziness

Cellular level:
EM penetrates a few milimeeters

Non thermal effects

blood: plasma, platelets, cells, perfect target fo rEM
Half of the blood is cells
Plasma can respond to EM, 

EM field: Mutation can happen, membrane deformation. Therefore it can impact blood flow


NEar field exposure, far field exposure
Red Blood Cells
Proteins

Increased deformability due to EM field
Deformability


sedimantation rate


PROTEIN LEVEL
Method
Dielectric spectroscopy
complex permitivity - fingerprint of material

Dielectric relaxation: how quickly material respond to E field

alpha/beta/gamma dispersion

Cole-Cole Model
Property description of material before and after exposure

Methemoglobin was tested

Measurement:
relaxation timie before and after EM field

Hemolysis was tested (highly concentrated hemoglobine)


Low level observation, didn't find adequacy to the current EM exposure standards

10dBm 50% Duty Cycle was used in experiments for 40 minutes

Different frequencies has different mechanisms
