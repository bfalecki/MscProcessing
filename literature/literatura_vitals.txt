OTHER INFORMATION
==============================================
Contactless and short‐range vital signs detection with doppler radar millimetre‐wave (76–81 GHz) sensing firmware
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11665778/#htl212075-bib-0033
	Conventional sensors can detect cardiac arrhythmia, heart conduction disorders, coronary ischemia, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation
	Described problems with ECG i PPG
	?:  Why respiratory signal looks so strange? Is it a raw signal (not a phase)?
	    Why radar measured heart cycles look so perfect? This is not a simulation
            Why baseband signal is real-, no complex-valued
    Methods:
      Frequency domain: for heartbeat and for breath: FFT of baseband signal (from real(baseband signal) or from phase ? - less probable, phase not mentioned)
      Time domain: equivalent to findpeaks(minpeakdist, minpeakheight) of baseband signal

template-waveform-based approach
A received signal is then modeled as a summation of these template waveforms with various coefficients and delays. The challenge in using this type of approach is that it is not always easy to compose an ideal template waveform from real measurement data.
