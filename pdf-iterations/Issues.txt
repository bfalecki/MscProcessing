"The second functionality is the classification of human behavior in the context of detecting dangerous falls."

COMMENT
maybe we can talk about explore the use of radar for detecting dangerous falls instead of talsk directly about classification as we will not be able to finis a classification module for different human behavior

FIX:
"The second functionality is the detection of dangerous human falls."

"The measurement of vital signs and the detection of falls will be performed continuously in near real time."

COMMENT:
do this real time works for both systems?

FIX:
if I manage to implement fall detection in real-time for CN0566
"In case of CN0566, the measurement of vital signs and the detection of falls will be performed continuously in near real time."

"Additionally, the system will be able to detect the presence
of a person within the range of the beam based on their movements. In the case of the
CN0566 phased array radar with angular resolution, the beam will automatically follow
the person. The results of the operation will be displayed to the user in a web application
on the phone or on a computer monitor."

COMMENT:
this may be change based on actual final development of the system
