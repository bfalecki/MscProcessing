ABSTRACT = {Remote vital sensing in veterinary medicine is a relatively new area of practice, which involves the acquisition of data without invasion of the body cavities of live animals. This paper aims to review several technologies in remote vital sensing: infrared thermography, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), radar, wearable sensors, and computer vision and machine learning. In each of these technologies, we outline its concepts, uses, strengths, and limitations in multiple animal species, and its potential to reshape health surveillance, welfare evaluation, and clinical medicine in animals. The review also provides information about the problems associated with applying these technologies, including species differences, external conditions, and the question of the reliability and classification of these technologies. Additional topics discussed in this review include future developments such as the use of artificial intelligence, combining different sensing methods, and creating monitoring solutions tailored to specific animal species. This contribution gives a clear understanding of the status and future possibilities of remote vital sensing in veterinary applications and stresses the importance of that technology for the development of the veterinary field in terms of animal health and science.},
