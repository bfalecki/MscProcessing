============================================== archiwum wiadomości

Thank you for your suggestion, I will contact Prof. Smolik to see if I should prepare a presentation.

As for the progress report, the document is being prepared - I have included a short description of the topic, the planned scope of work, a short description of XY-DemoRad and CN0566 and information on what has been done so far. I also plan to include new processing results, possibly a general block diagram of the system.

Recently, I have formulated a preliminary structure of the work, the scope of research and the main goal. I think I should consult it with you, so I am sending it separately as an attachment. Perhaps the plans are too ambitious, but I thought that the real-time implementation will be done for the Radarconf Challenge anyway. I have also added a display in the web application to add an IoT element (like in a smart home).

I have some concerns about the requirement that the solution to the given task requires research elements. It seems to me that a comparison of the performance of different algorithms in specific conditions and choosing the appropriate one for implementation in the system would be enough.

In master's theses there is still a requirement to improve/develop a new technical solution. It is possible that the structure of the system itself will suffice here - if it is something different from existing solutions. It may be possible to develop/improve some processing algorithms, especially those with time-frequency methods.
